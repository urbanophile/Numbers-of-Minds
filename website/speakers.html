                  <h4><a href="#">Rintaro Higuchi</a> - International Center for Materials Nanoarchitectonics</h4>
                  <p>My research interest is in the dynamics of the conductive network and brain-like computing based on the network materials. The networks composed of conductive polymer or polymer-coated silver nanowire exhibited spontaneous fluctuation, which behaviors are analogous with biological network system such as neuron activity. I’m presently studying on the investigation of network dynamics, particularly silver nanowire network, using scanning probe microscopy and fluorescent microscopy, and also trying to apply these materials to practical devices.</p>

                  <p>Soroosh’s research focuses on functional connectivity of the human brain. Using neuroimaging techniques and statistical methods, he develops frameworks aiming to facilitate group inference to gain a better understanding into changes in the human brain due to neuropsychiatric disorders. He completed his PhD in 2016 at the Institute of Digital Healthcare, University of Warwick. His thesis was focused on developing network statistical methods to describe the human ‘connectomics’ in healthy and disordered subjects. Prior to his PhD, in 2012, he graduated in Electronic Engineering from the University of Birmingham. Since October 2016, he has undertaken a fellowship at the Institute of Advanced Study (IAS), University of Warwick. His research at IAS is focused on the novel area of ‘population connectomics’ which aims to integrate topological features of the brain with other available phenotypes through large-scale data-sets to explore the interaction between the human brain, demographics, behavior and lifestyle.</p>

                  <h4><a href="http://www.stat.rice.edu/~gallen/">Genevera Allen</a> - Rice University</h4>
                  <p>My research interests are in developing statistical tools to help scientists understand massive amounts of so-called "Big-Data". Technological advances in medicine, engineering, the Internet, and finance have produced larger and more complex data sets. By using techniques from high-dimensional inference, machine learning, and convex optimization, I solve statistical problems arising from these new technologies. In particular, my methodological and theoretical work lies in the areas of modern multivariate analysis, graphical models, statistical machine learning, and the emerging area of data integration. My applied research interests include neuroimaging, neural recordings, and high-throughput genomics. </p>

                  <h4><a href="https://elizabethmargaretsweeney.wordpress.com/">Elisabeth Sweeney</a> - Rice University</h4>
                  <p>Recently, Elizabeth’s focus is on Alzheimer’s disease (AD), arguably one of the largest public health crises of our time. As part of a prestigious postdoctoral fellowship program at Rice University, Elizabeth is diving into large high-dimensional neuroimaging, genetic and epidemiological data and discovering biomarkers of cognitive reserve, or the difference among individuals that enables some to be more resilient to the brain changes associated with AD than others.</p>
