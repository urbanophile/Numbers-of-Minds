                  <p>Dr Afyouni’s completed his PhD in 2016 at the Institute of Digital Healthcare, University of Warwick. His thesis was focused on developing network statistical methods to describe the human ‘connectomics’ in healthy and disordered subjects. Prior to his PhD, in 2012, he graduated in Electronic Engineering from the University of Birmingham. Since October 2016, he has undertaken a fellowship at the Institute of Advanced Study (IAS), University of Warwick. his thesis focused on developing functional connectivity of the human brain. Using neuroimaging techniques and statistical methods, he develops frameworks aiming to facilitate group inference to gain a better understanding into changes in the human brain due to neuropsychiatric disorders. His research at IAS is focused on the novel area of ‘population connectomics’ which aims to integrate topological features of the brain with other available phenotypes through large-scale data-sets to explore the interaction between the human brain, demographics, behavior and lifestyle.</p>
